	*) how to find who deleted the rows in table?
	- we need to read transaction log file to find info about the deleted rows and login associated with it.

		use <database1_name>
		go    
		fn_dblog(NULL, NULL) 
		
		-- get the transaction sid from above query.
		USE MASTER
		GO   
		SELECT SUSER_SNAME(get transaction sid from above query)
